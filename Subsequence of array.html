    <!--
        A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
         zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
For the same example, there are 15 sub-sequences. They are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), 
(1,3),(1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,3,4), (2,3,4), (1,2,3,4). More generally,
 we can say that for a sequence of size n, we can have (2n-1) non-empty sub-sequences in total. 
A string example to differentiate: Consider strings “geeksforgeeks” and “gks”.
 “gks” is a subsequence of “geeksforgeeks” but not a substring. “geeks” is both a subsequence and subarray.
  Every subarray is a subsequence. More specifically, Subsequence is a generalization of substring.
